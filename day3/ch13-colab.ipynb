Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["2/2 [==============================] - 0s 5ms/step - loss: 0.6143 - accuracy: 0.8537\n","2/2 [==============================] - 0s 7ms/step - loss: 0.6793 - accuracy: 0.7805\n","정확도: [0.8571428656578064, 0.8333333134651184, 0.8095238208770752, 0.8536585569381714, 0.7804877758026123]\n","정확도 평균: 0.8268292665481567\n"]}],"source":["# 몇 겹으로 나눌 것인지를 정합니다. \n","k=5\n","\n","# KFold 함수를 불러옵니다. 분할하기 전에 샘플이 치우치지 않도록 섞어 줍니다.\n","kfold = KFold(n_splits=k, shuffle=True)\n","\n","# 정확도가 채워질 빈 리스트를 준비합니다.\n","acc_score = []\n","\n","def model_fn():\n","    model = Sequential() # 딥러닝 모델의 구조를 시작합니다.\n","    model.add(Dense(24, input_dim=60, activation='relu'))\n","    model.add(Dense(10, activation='relu'))\n","    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))\n","    return model\n","\n","# K겹 교차 검증을 이용해 k번의 학습을 실행합니다. \n","for train_index , test_index in kfold.split(X):  # for 문에 의해서 k번 반복합니다. spilt()에 의해 k개의 학습셋, 테스트셋으로 분리됩니다.\n","    X_train , X_test = X.iloc[train_index,:], X.iloc[test_index,:]  \n","    y_train , y_test = y.iloc[train_index], y.iloc[test_index]\n","\n","    model = model_fn()\n","    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])\n","    history=model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=200, batch_size=10, verbose=0) \n","    \n","    accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)[1]  # 정확도를 구합니다.\n","    acc_score.append(accuracy)  # 정확도 리스트에 저장합니다.\n","\n","# k번 실시된 정확도의 평균을 구합니다.\n","avg_acc_score = sum(acc_score)/k\n","\n","# 결과를 출력합니다.\n","print('정확도:', acc_score)\n","print('정확도 평균:', avg_acc_score)"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"https://github.com/taehojo/deeplearning/blob/master/colab/ch13-colab.ipynb","timestamp":1674880481702},{"file_id":"https://github.com/taehojo/deeplearning/blob/master/colab/ch13-colab.ipynb","timestamp":1642730761008}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.7"},"accelerator":"GPU","gpuClass":"standard"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
